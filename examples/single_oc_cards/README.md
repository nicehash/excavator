Following speeds are achieved:


GPU | Core clock delta | Memory clock delta | Power limit (W) | Speed (MH/s)
----|------------------|--------------------|-----------------|-------------
3060 Ti | -500 | 1200 | 130 | **60**
3060 Ti | -500 | 1250 | 130 | **61**
3070 | -600 | 1200 | 130 | **60**
3080 | -150 | 900 | 220 | **96**
3090 | -300 | 950 | 285 | **118**

Provided overclocks are modest and should work on (almost) any card. Higher speeds are possible with more aggressive settings.

**Warning for 3080/3090!** Make sure your RAM chips are properly cooled. If you cannot achieve this speed, it is because your RAM is too hot and the card is throttling.
